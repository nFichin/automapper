automapper
==========
Simple automapper experiment using C++ and SDL 2.0
You place road tiles in the game space, and the automapper tool automagically adapts the existing road tiles to always form a conected road.

I'm using Eclipse CDT IDE in my Linux (Debian) box, the project is configured to be built looking for SDL library and headers in the standard Linux location.
