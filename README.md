automapper
==========
Simple automapper experiment using C++ and SDL 2.0

You place road tiles in the game space, and the automapper tool automagically adapts the existing road tiles to always form a connected road.

I'm using Eclipse CDT IDE in my Linux (Debian) box, Project configuration files are included, you should have SDL and SDL_image libraries installed in your system.

For Windows I'm using VS2012, all SDL files for windows are included.
