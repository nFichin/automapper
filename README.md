automapper
==========
Simple automapper experiment using C++ and SDL 2.0
You place road tiles in the game space, and the automapper tool automagically adapts the existing road tiles to always form a conected road.

I'm using Eclipse CDT IDE in my Linux (Debian) box, the project is configured to be built looking for SDL library and headers in the standard Linux location.
Project configuration files are included.
