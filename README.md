automapper
==========
Simple automapper experiment using C++ and SDL 2.0

You place road tiles in the game space, and the automapper tool automagically adapts the existing road tiles to always form a connected road.

I'm using Eclipse CDT IDE in my Linux (Debian) box, project configuration files are included, you should have SDL 2.0 and SDL_image libraries installed in your system. Check http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php 

For Windows I'm using VS2012, all SDL developing files are included.

In the "bin" folder you'll find the Windows compiled binary as well as the required run-time libraries. Linux binary is also included.
